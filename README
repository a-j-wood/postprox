Introduction
************

This is the README for `postprox', a minimal Postfix SMTP proxy.  Postprox
is an SMTP proxy which copies an SMTP conversation between its input and
another SMTP server, but spools the DATA portion to a temporary file and
runs a specified program on it before passing it on to the output server -
or outputting an SMTP error code instead if the content filter says so.


Documentation
*************

A manual page is included in this distribution.  If you prefer plain text,
then look at `doc/quickref.txt' for a text version.


Dependencies
************

This package was written to be used as a before-queue or after-queue Postfix
content filter.  It reads and writes SMTP on stdin/out, so may or may not be
usable with other mailers.


Compilation
***********

To compile the package, type "sh ./configure", which should generate a
Makefile for your system.  You may then type "make" to build everything. 
You may need GNU `make' for compilation to work properly.

See the file `doc/INSTALL' for more about the `configure' script.

Developers note that you can do "./configure --enable-debugging" to cause
debugging support to be built in.  Also note that doing "make index" will
generate an HTML code index (using `ctags' and `cproto'); this index lists
all files used, all functions defined, and all TODOs marked in the code.

Memory allocation tracing (MALLOC_TRACE) may cause a crash if the allocation
log file gets too large (>2GB usually).  This is a bug in the C library;
unfortunately it cannot be fixed in `qsf'.
