Title: Minimal Postfix SMTP Proxy Documentation Index
Author: Andrew Wood
Abstract: The minimal Postfix SMTP proxy copies an SMTP conversation between its input and another SMTP server, but spools the DATA portion to a temporary file and runs a specified program on it before passing it on to the output server - or outputting an SMTP error code instead if the content filter says so.
