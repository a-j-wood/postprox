.SH DESCRIPTION
.B @PACKAGE@
reads SMTP commands on standard input and passes them on to the specified
mail server unchanged, except for the DATA portion.  Output from the
specified mail server is passed back to standard output.  The DATA portion
from the input mail server (stdin) is spooled to a temporary file so that
.B COMMAND
can be run on it; if
.B COMMAND
exits with a non-zero exit status, its standard error is passed as an SMTP
error to the input SMTP server (on stdout) and the connection to the output
SMTP server is aborted with a QUIT.

.B @PACKAGE@
is intended to be used in a
.BR postfix (1)
configuration as a before-queue or after-queue content filter.

See the
.B EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION
section for an example of how to use
.B @PACKAGE@
as a before-queue content filter.

.SH OPTIONS
The
.B @PACKAGE@
options are listed below.
.TP
.BI "\-c, \-\-command " COMMAND
Use
.I COMMAND
as the filtering command.  This will be passed to
.B sh -c
when executed.

When
.B COMMAND
is run, the environment variable
.B EMAIL
will be set to the filename of the email to be processed, and the
environment variable
.B OUTFILE
will be set to the filename of an existing empty file which the filter can
optionally put a modified version of the message into.

See the
.B ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
section below for more details.

The exit status of
.B COMMAND
determines whether the email will be passed through or rejected.  An exit
status of 0 means to pass the email through, 1 means to reject it - the last
line of
.BR COMMAND 's
standard error output will be used as the error text, and unless it starts
with a 3-digit number and a space, it will be prefixed with 554 (SMTP hard
error).  An exit code of 2 or more means the filter failed to run correctly.

If the contents of
.B OUTFILE
are left alone by
.B COMMAND
then an exit status of 0 means to pass the email through as it was received.
If
.B OUTFILE
contains anything at all, then an exit status of 0 will cause the contents of
.B OUTFILE
to be passed through instead of the original email.

.TP
.BI "\-d, \-\-tempdir " "DIR"
Use
.B DIR
to store temporary files in, instead of the default of
.BR /tmp .
.TP
.BI "\-t, \-\-timeout " "TIMEOUT"
If the filter command takes longer than
.B TIMEOUT
seconds to run, it will be killed and the email will be allowed to pass
through (or will be rejected if
.B -r
was specified).  The default timeout is 30 seconds.
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-reject
If the filter command times out or cannot be run, reject the message with a
451 (temporary failure) error instead of allowing it through.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
By default only errors and warnings are logged.  Adding
.B \-v
options increases the amount of information logged.
.TP
.BI "\-l, \-\-listen " [IP:]PORT
Instead of reading from the input SMTP server on standard input, go into the
background and listen on the given
.B IP:PORT
combination for connections.  The default IP is 127.0.0.1 if not specified.
Listen mode is not recommended because then
.B postfix
can't restart
.B @PACKAGE@
if it is killed for any reason.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print a usage message on standard output and exit successfully.
.TP
.B \-L, \-\-license
Print details of the program's license on standard output and exit
successfully.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version         
Print version information, including a list of available database backends,
on standard output and exit successfully.

.SH EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION

This configuration is based on steps outlined in the file SMTPD_PROXY_README
included with
.BR postfix (1).
It can be read online here:

  http://www.postfix.org/SMTPD_PROXY_README.html

First, set up a user to run the filter as, such as
.BR filter .

Next, create a script or program which can be run on an email (the filename
of the email to examine will be in the environment variable
.BR EMAIL ),
and which will exit with status 0 if the email is to be accepted, 1 if it is
to be rejected, or anything else if there was a problem with an aspect of
the filter itself.  The filter script can also output an SMTP error on
standard error if you would like customised error responses.

For instance, a script to scan all incoming email with
.BR clamdscan (1)
would look like this:

.RS
 #!/bin/sh
 /usr/bin/clamdscan --disable-summary --stdout - < "$EMAIL"
 STATUS=$?
 [ -z "$STATUS" ] && STATUS=2
 [ $STATUS -eq 0 ] && exit 0
 if [ $STATUS -eq 1 ]; then
         echo 550 Message contains a virus 1>&2
         exit 1
 fi
 exit 2
.RE

Now you need to reconfigure
.BR postfix (1).
Add the following to
.IR /etc/postfix/main.cf :

.RS
 smtpd_proxy_filter=127.0.0.1:10025
.RE

Now add the following to the bottom of
.IR /etc/postfix/master.cf :

.RS
 # SMTP proxy.
 #
 127.0.0.1:10025 inet n  n       n       -       20      spawn
     user=\fBfilter\fR argv=/usr/sbin/@PACKAGE@ -v -c \fBCOMMAND\fR 127.0.0.1:10026

 #
 # After-filter SMTP server. Receive mail from the content filter
 # on localhost port 10026.
 #
 127.0.0.1:10026 inet n  -       n       -        -      smtpd
     -o smtpd_authorized_xforward_hosts=127.0.0.0/8           
     -o smtpd_client_restrictions=
     -o smtpd_helo_restrictions=
     -o smtpd_sender_restrictions=   
     -o smtpd_recipient_restrictions=permit_mynetworks,reject
     -o smtpd_data_restrictions=
     -o smtpd_junk_command_limit=100000
     -o smtpd_soft_error_limit=10000   
     -o smtpd_error_sleep_time=0
     -o smtpd_proxy_filter=
     -o mynetworks=127.0.0.0/8
     -o receive_override_options=no_unknown_recipient_checks
.RE

Finally, do
.B postfix reload
and watch the mail logs to ensure that it's working.  Send a few test emails
to satisfy yourself that the system is still processing mail correctly.

Remember to replace
.B COMMAND
in the above example with the full path to your filtering script.  The
script must be executable by the
.B filter
user.

The number just before
.B spawn
in the first line of the addition to master.cf is the maximum number of
proxy processes to spawn.  Adjust this according to the needs of your
system.

See the documentation for
.BR master (5)
for further details of the format of
.IR /etc/postfix/master.cf .

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The following environment variables are available to any filter command:

.TP
.B EMAIL
The filename of the email to be processed.  Do not modify this file.
.TP
.B OUTFILE
The filename of the output file.  If this is not left empty, then when the
message is accepted by the filter, the contents of this file will be sent
instead of the contents of
.BR EMAIL .
.TP
.B SENDER
The envelope sender (SMTP MAIL FROM) of the email, if known.  An empty
sender (i.e. bounce) is denoted by <>, otherwise this will be an email
address or, if not known, a blank string.
.TP
.B RECIPIENT
The
.B first
envelope recipient (SMTP RCPT TO) of the email, if known.  Only the first
recipient given is put into this variable.  If the envelope recipient is not
known, this variable will be a blank string.
.TP
.B REMOTEIP
The IP address of the sending server, as collected from the SMTP XFORWARD
command.  If not known, this variable will be a blank string.
.TP
.B HELO
The SMTP HELO string the sending server used to identify itself, if known,
or a blank string if not.

.P

Note that only the
.B EMAIL
and
.B OUTFILE
variables can be trusted, as these are generated by
.BR @PACKAGE@ .
Everything else is supplied by a potentially hostile remote host, so should
be used with care.  If your script uses the shell at all, make sure you
always fully quote these variables.

Also note that everything but
.B EMAIL
and
.B OUTFILE
will be truncated to a maximum of 99 characters.
